    title: 'Top 5 Corporate Event Catering Trends in Dubai (2025)',
    excerpt: 'From sustainable sourcing to interactive food stations, discover what is defining the corporate event scene this year.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-6">The corporate event landscape in Dubai is ever-evolving. As we move into 2025, companies are looking for more than just a buffet; they want an experience. Here are the top trends we are seeing:</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">1. Sustainable & Local Sourcing</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Sustainability is no longer a buzzword but a requirement. Clients are increasingly asking for menus that feature locally sourced ingredients from UAE farms to reduce carbon footprints.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">2. Interactive Live Stations</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Gone are the days of static warmers. Live cooking stations—where chefs prepare sushi, pasta, or grills on demand—add a layer of entertainment and freshness that guests love.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">3. Healthy & Dietary Inclusive Options</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Inclusivity is key. Menus now standardly include vegan, gluten-free, and keto options without compromising on taste or presentation.</p>

      <p>At CaterTech, we stay ahead of these trends to ensure your corporate gathering is not just a meeting, but a memorable culinary journey.</p>

    title: 'Why Renting Event Furniture is Smarter Than Buying',
    excerpt: 'Planning a one-off event? Learn why renting premium furniture offers better flexibility, cost-savings, and style.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-6">When organizing an event, the logistics of furniture can be a headache. Should you buy chairs? Where will you store them? Here is why renting is the superior choice for most event planners.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">Cost Efficiency</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Purchasing high-quality Chiavari chairs or leather sofas requires significant capital. Renting allows you to access luxury items for a fraction of the cost, keeping your budget open for catering and entertainment.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">Style Flexibility</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Every event has a different theme. One week it's a rustic outdoor wedding, the next a sleek corporate gala. Renting gives you access to a vast inventory, ensuring your furniture always matches your vision perfectly.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">Zero Storage Hassles</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">After the party ends, you don't want to be stuck with 500 chairs. We handle delivery, setup, and collection, so you can focus on your guests.</p>

    title: 'Creating the Perfect Wedding Menu: A Step-by-Step Guide',
    excerpt: 'Your wedding food is what guests will remember. Here is how to curate a menu that reflects your story and delights every palate.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-6">Food is the heart of any wedding celebration. It brings people together and sets the tone for the evening. Here is how to plan a menu that wows.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">1. Define Your Style</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Are you envisioning a formal sit-down dinner or a relaxed buffet? Your service style will dictate the menu choices.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">2. Seasonal is Best</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Ingredients taste best when they are in season. For a winter wedding in Dubai, think warm, comforting spices and rich meats. For summer, go light and fresh.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-cater-blue mb-4">3. The Tasting Session</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">Never skip the tasting! It's the fun part, but also crucial. It allows you to tweak spice levels and presentation before the big day.</p>
